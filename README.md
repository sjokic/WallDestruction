## Demo
![](https://github.com/sjokic/WallDestruction/blob/main/wall-destruction.gif?raw=true)
Note that this demo was generated by exporting, every few simulation steps, an .obj file for each mesh contained in the scene by using the framework provided in this repository. These .obj files were then rendered in Blender.

## Instructions
Depending on the cmake setup, the data path to the obj files might incorrect. This can be adjusted in the `init` function
in `RigidBodySim.h`. By default, the (piecewise) wall and a ball will be loaded. In addition, the simulation can be recorded by uncommenting the first chunk in the `advance` function in `RigidBodySim`. This is done by saving each mesh present in the scene into an .obj file every few simulation steps during the recording. We wrote a blender
script `blender_export_script.py` to merge the individual objects per frame into a multi-object file.

## Installation

Install cmake with apt.
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```
or with MacPorts on macOS:
```
sudo port install cmake.
```
On Windows, download it:
[https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)

### Note for linux users

On ubuntu, build essentials for compilation, libgl and mesa drivers might be needed:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev libblas-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev
```

### Building

```
cd pbs20-wall; mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
It is recommended to run cmake in `RELEASE` mode for better performance.

Compile and run the executable, e.g. Ubuntu:
```
make
```
